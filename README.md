This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Project is a resoult of recruitment  assignment for Ardoq.

## Chalenge

1: Create a function that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product between three of those numbers. For example, given the list [1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] the highest product would be 10 * 6 * 5 = 300

2: Oslo city bikes has an open API showing real-time data on location and state of the bike stations. 

Your task is to create a small application that utilizes this api to show the stations and the amount of available bikes and free spots a station currently has. Youâ€™re free to choose which language and libraries you use. How you show the stations and status is also up to you. 

The api can be found at https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid

## Solution

1. Function can be find in src/taskFunction.ts with test in taskFunction.tes.ts 

2. I used **TypeScript** and **React.js** with **styled-components** and **google maps API** to show oslo city bikes stations.

    i also used some icons from flaticon.com
